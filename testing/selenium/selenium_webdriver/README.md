# Testing - Selenium - Selenium WebDriver

## Purpose

Selenium WebDriver is best used for creating robust, browser-based automated
test suites. It is a suite of tools to automate web browsers. It has the
ability to run in many browsers and operating systems and can be controlled by
many programming languages and testing frameworks. See
[Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver) for more
information.

## Set up

A great place to start with Selenium is their documentation
[Selenium WebDriver Documentation](http://http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp).

Another good resource for Selenium Dave Haeffner's
[Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com) which is a weekly email of
Selenium tips. All of these tips are archived on the site so you do not
necessarily need to sign up for the emails. He also has a Bootcamp that you can
sign up for on this site.
