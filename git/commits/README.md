# Git - Commits

Commits must have the following format. It provides human readability as raw
Markdown as well as HTML, and it allows for simple machine parsing.

```
Summarize in the imperative, with <= 50 characters

* An optional detail with <= 72 characters per line.
* Another optional detail with <= 72 characters per line.

[#pivotal story id]
```

Note that the **imperative** form and the **whitespace** are **required**. The
bullet points are _optional_.
