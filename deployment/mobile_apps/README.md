# Deployment - Mobile Applications

## Application version

All applications should be versioned using semantic versioning. Someone using
the application on their mobile device should be able to find the version
under Settings > Apps > (name of application). This version number should be
tied to a release number on GitHub.

## Hockey App

All mobile hybrid applications will use Hockey App for alpha and beta
distribution, whether private or public.
