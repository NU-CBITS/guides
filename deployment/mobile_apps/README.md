# Deployment - Mobile Applications

## Application version

All applications should be versioned using semantic versioning. Someone using
the application on their mobile device should be able to find the version
under Settings > Apps > (name of application). This version number should be
tied to a release number on GitHub.

## Download page

Projects that have a dashboard component should have a download page publicly
accessible (unless otherwise specified) where the apk for the file can be
downloaded. This page should show the current version number of the application
as well as its release date.
