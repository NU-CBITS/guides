# Tools - HockeyApp

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net) is a web service used to distribute beta versions, collect live crash reports, get feedback from real users and analyze test coverage for mobile applications.

## Exception documentation process

In order to capture and use all of the information gained from the HockeyApp crash reports, follow these steps upon notification:
1. Create a Pivotal bug story for the issue.
2. Add details to the bug story with a summary, context, and a URL to the HockeyApp crash group.
3. Finally annotate the HockeyApp crash group with a link to the Pivotal bug.
4. After the bug is fixed and the Pivotal story is delivered, mark the HockeyApp crash group as complete.
