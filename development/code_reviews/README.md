# Development - Code reviews

An essential part of development is having at least one other person review
changes. This fosters communication, learning and a better product.

Every commit **must** be reviewed and signed off on by a peer with the following
exceptions:

* emergency patches to production **when no one is available to review**
* version bump and CHANGELOG update to go with a
  [tagged release](../development/releases)
* update of a **development or testing dependency** version

Commits may be reviewed in bulk as part of a [pull request](../../git/pull_requests).

Reviews are done within GitHub, and comments **may** be added to specific
lines, commits or pull requests.

## Comments

Comments **must** be respectful, and **should** come in the form of a question
or suggestion but **should not** come in the form of a demand.
