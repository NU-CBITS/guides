# Development - Releases

Note: **this document is a stub**

When a library or application is considered stable, it **may** be released. A
release **must not** be part of a [pull request](../../git/pull_requests). Tags on
separate branches lead to "tag pollution", and should generally be used only
when there is a need to maintain multiple versions.

## Semantic versioning

A release **must** have a git tag that follows semantic versioning.
