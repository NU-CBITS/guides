# Development - Estimation

Estimating the length of time required and difficulty involved in each step of
development is an important part of the process. It forces us to think through
our plan and it allows us to better gauge the scope and progress of our work.

## Overlooked steps

The following steps in the development process are often overlooked or
underestimated in the planning stages, but should be estimated just like other
stories.

* configuration of the staging and production servers
* configuration of services and tools
* domain/logical model and schema design
* technical documentation
* end user documentation
* manual testing

## Story breakdown

Stories that involve writing code should be more detailed the longer the
estimated time to completion and the greater the estimated difficulty.
If your plan includes the files that must be modified, added and deleted,
your estimate can be far more accurate.

## Adjustments

Estimates **must** be updated as work proceeds if new information becomes
available or if the details change.
